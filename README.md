# Optimization Technics

this project contains a resume for the optimization technics course

## What is Optimization?

Optimization is the process of finding the best solution to a problem. The best solution is the one that has the best value for the objective function. The objective function is the function that we want to maximize or minimize. The best solution is the one that has the best value for the objective function. The objective function is the function that we want to maximize or minimize.

## What is the problem complexity?

the problem complexity is the number of operations that we need to do to solve the problem. it can be calculated by the following formula:

```math
C = \frac{1}{2}n^2 + \frac{1}{2}n
```
