# What is the problem complexity?

the problem complexity is the number of operations that we need to do to solve the problem. 
by this number we can devide the problem into 3 categories :

* polynomial complexity
* NP complexity

# What is the polynomial complexity?

the polynomial complexity is the complexity that is polynomial to the number of variables.
for example if we have a problem with 3 variables, the complexity will be O(n^3).

# What is the NP complexity?

the NP complexity stands for non-deterministic polynomial complexity. it's the hardest complexity to solve. it's the complexity that is not polynomial to the number of variables.
# is Every NP problem is Polynomial?

as for now we don't know if every NP problem is polynomial. but we know that every polynomial problem is NP.

# Example of NP problems

* traveling salesman problem

# Example of polynomial problems

* graph coloring problem



# solve a problem with polynomial complexity

## graph coloring problem

the graph coloring problem is the problem of coloring the nodes of a graph with a minimum number of colors. the graph coloring problem is the problem of coloring the nodes of a graph with a minimum number of colors. the graph coloring problem is the problem of coloring the nodes of a graph with a minimum number of colors.
as this the number of nodes is the number of variables, it grows polynomially. so the complexity of this problem is polynomial.

# solve a problem with NP complexity

## traveling salesman problem

the traveling salesman problem is the problem of finding the shortest path that visits every node in a graph. the traveling salesman problem is the problem of finding the shortest path that visits every node in a graph. the traveling salesman problem is the problem of finding the shortest path that visits every node in a graph. 
as this the number of nodes is the number of variables, it grows exponentially. so the complexity of this problem is NP.
