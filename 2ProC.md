## What is the problem complexity?

the problem complexity is the number of operations that we need to do to solve the problem. 
by this number we can devide the problem into 3 categories :

* polynomial complexity
* NP complexity

## What is the polynomial complexity?

the polynomial complexity is the complexity that is polynomial to the number of variables.
for example if we have a problem with 3 variables, the complexity will be O(n^3).

## What is the NP complexity?

the NP complexity stands for non-deterministic polynomial complexity. it's the hardest complexity to solve.

## is Every NP problem is Polynomial?

as for now we don't know if every NP problem is polynomial. but we know that every polynomial problem is NP.
